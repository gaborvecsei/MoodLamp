# MoodLamp

This is the code and setup for an awesome mood lamp with an RGB led.

This was a project for my girlfriend.
A mood light what you can control with claps.

The states are:
Turn on -> Cycle thru colors -> Stop at a color -> Turn off

## What you'll need

- Arduino (I use Arduino Nano)
- 3 Resistors (270 Ohm)
- RGB Led
- Wires
- Breadboard (optional for easy assembling)

## Setup

| Sound Sensor | Arduino |
|:------------:|:-------:|
| VCC          | 3V3     |
| GND          | GND     |
| OUT          | PIN4    |

| RGB Led | Arduino |
|:-------:|:-------:|
| Cathode | GND     |
| Red     | PIN11   |
| Green   | PIN10   |
| Blue    | PIN9    |

Do not forget that you have to use the resistors. Connect them to 
the red, green, blue pins!
