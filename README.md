## What you need

- Arduino (I use Arduino Nano)
- 3 Resistors (270 Ohm)
- RGB Led
- Wires
- Breadboard (optional for easy assembling)

## Setup

| Sound Sensor | Arduino |
|:------------:|:-------:|
| VCC          | 3V3     |
| GND          | GND     |
| OUT          | PIN4    |

| RGB Led | Arduino |
|:-------:|:-------:|
| Cathode | GND     |
| Red     | PIN11   |
